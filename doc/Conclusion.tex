\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chap:conclusion}
Concluding, we presented a bounded model checking tool which covers a subset of
the Java language. The examples in the appendix show that the tool can correctly 
detect errors in algorithms, like merge sort. Making this a feasible approach to
formally verify Java source code, instead of Java bytecode, which other bounded
model checking tools focus on.

\section{Possible future work}
\subsection*{Extend the subset of the Java language}
Currently, the tool only allows for the verification of a subset of the Java
language. This can be extended to allow for more Java programs to be verified.

One specific example is allowing \javainline{break} and \javainline{continue}
statements inside a \javainline{try}, \javainline{catch}, or \javainline{finally}
block inside a loop.

\subsection*{Add support for multi-threaded programs}
The developers of JBMC claim to have multi-threading support as one of their top
priorities. When JBMC supports multi-threading, the tool can be extended to support
multi-threading as well.
